###  Occurances of words in CS degree class descriptions

I took all the course descriptions from 5 universities Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science and put the words in text files. (University of Colorado - Denver, MIT, Stanford, Carnegie Mellon, Berkeley). Then I counted and sorted them.

*** This project orders the number of occurances for each word. ***

#### Instructions

1. Fill a txt file with whatever text you want

2. Run `node map.js` in the root directory. It currently appends to the output file, so you'll have to delete its contents every time.
